            <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied servant of man's necessity. He "took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses," that He might minister to every need of humanity. The burden of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to remove. It was His mission to bring to men complete restoration; He came to give them health and peace and perfection of character.<br />

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									<p>Scroll down and click the yellow 'Donate' button below to begin.</p>
									The total cost of purchasing this facility is <b>$1,500,000</b>. You can donate using any currency to help raise funds for this purpose. We cannot achieve this goal without the support of generous donors like you.</p>
								<p>We are appealing to you, our brothers and sisters worldwide, to join us in making this vision a reality. Your contributions will directly support the acquisition of this facility, enabling us to expand our ministry and reach more people with the healing message of Christ.</p>
								

									<h3 class="major">SPECIAL APPEAL</h3>
								<p>Much greetings to you all.
								<br/><br/>
I believe some of you in Africa, North America, Australia, Asia, and Europe we may have met, but the majority of you,  we haven't. Nevertheless, I consider you my brothers and sisters in Christ and request you to forward this appeal for donations to as many of your families and friends,  until the outstanding balance in this project's donations infrastructure appears as US$ 0.
<br/><br/>
Technology has made the globe a village! Together, we are going to touch people's lives. Some we may not see, however,  glory is to our creator God. 
We need 1,500,000 US dollars to purchase this home for our care and concern ministry. This is a huge sum of money! But remember, God has more than 1,500,000 people all over the world willing to support his work. Suppose by faith, of the many, only 1,500,000 decided to donate one US$  today - the work of the Lord shall commence immediately in these premises. I earnestly pray that the Holy Spirit prepares you as you make the decision to donate and support this mission as the Lord, God leads you in whatever currency Paypal shall accept. 
<br/>
Thank you, and may God bless you abundantly.

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Why be healthy?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>We need health to be alive and effectively listen, and respond positively to the work of the Lord. If we are unwell, we may not be able to take the message to the whole world effectively.</p>
								<p>In Matthew chapter 28:18-20, Jesus said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."</p>
								<p>In light of the above, we need health not necessarily to enjoy or be proud about it, but to be able to work as per the commission given by Jesus. Jesus came for us all and every human being has an equal opportunity to be saved and anyone who calls upon Jesus in faith will be saved.</p>
								<p>It is my and your responsibility to know and tell all nations about Jesus, and what He is saying. For that purpose, we need life and health to be able to effectively live by, and take that message to people. The recipients also have to be alive and healthy, to be able to accept to hear, and interpret that message correctly, then make the right choice of obeying and living according to the ten commandments of God. All other good reasons for health may be added benefits.</p>
								<p>It is very important then to understand from the very beginning that, there are laws governing health, and that we are responsible to bring our individual life practices into harmony with those laws. Thus is the main purpose of <b>Bethlehem Telephone Sanitarium Inc.</b></p>
